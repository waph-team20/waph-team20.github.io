    <p>A simple HTML page </p>
    Using the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html"> W3Schools template</a>
    <p>In this course we students will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS)
      and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with
      hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid
      potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
    <p>Till now we have completed Lab-0, Lab-1, Lab-2, Hackathon-1, Individual project-1</p>
    <h3>Lab-0 Overview</h3>
    <p>In the initial part of the Web Application Programming and Hacking courseâ€™s Lab 0, I successfully established
      the groundwork for my development environment. This involved setting up an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine through
      the UC Sandbox. To enhance the functionality of the environment, I installed essential software such as apache2,
      git, sublime text, pandoc, and the Chrome browser. Additionally, I created a private git repository on GitHub and
      shared it with the instructor, Dr. Phu Phung. The subsequent steps included cloning the repository locally, making
      edits to the README.md file, and performing the prescribed Lab 0 exercises. The entire process was documented
      using Markdown, and I utilized the Pandoc tool to convert the document into a PDF format suitable for submission.

    <h3>Lab-1 Overview</h3>
    <p>The lab was divided into two parts, focusing on understanding the Web and HTTP Protocol, and engaging in Basic
      Web
      Application Programming. In the first part, I adeptly utilized the Wireshark tool to capture and analyze HTTP
      communication between my machine and a web server. I meticulously documented the process, including HTTP Request,
      Response messages, and the HTTP Stream, providing clear insights into the intricacies of the protocol. The second
      part involved the development of CGI web applications in C and a simple PHP web application, demonstrating my
      ability
      to code, compile, and deploy programs on the web server. I successfully created a Hello World CGI program, another
      CGI
      program with an HTML template, and PHP scripts. Additionally, I examined HTTP GET and POST requests using
      Wireshark
      and curl, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of these protocols. Here is the url of Lab 1 in my github
      repository:

    <h3>Lab-2 Overview</h3>
    <p>The lab consists of two tasks. In the first section, I created a basic HTML page with JavaScript and forms. I
      created
      a webpage waph-yourusername.html with HTML, featuring an image, a form, and interactive JavaScript elements such
      as
      date/time display and key press logging. Task 2 involved Ajax for user input, displaying responses dynamically,
      CSS styling,
      jQuery integration for Ajax requests, and Web API interactions for fetching programming jokes and predicting age
      based on user input.
      This lab provided hands-on experience in web development, covering HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and API
      integration.

    <h3>Hackathon-1 Overview</h3>
    <p>The Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Hackathon is an educational exercise designed to explore and understand various
      levels of XSS
      vulnerabilities in web applications. XSS is a common security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject
      malicious scripts into
      web pages viewed by other users. The hackathon consists of two main tasks: Task 1 focuses on identifying and
      exploiting XSS vulnerabilities
      in a target web application, while Task 2 involves implementing defenses against XSS attacks to mitigate the risk
      of exploitation.

    <h3>Individual Project- 1 Overview</h3>
    <p>This project involves creating a portfolio to highlight my skills and attract potential employers. It has been
      uploaded to a public
      repository. In addition to including information from my resume, I also completed extra tasks assigned by my
      professor,
      many of which were covered in previous labs.</p>
